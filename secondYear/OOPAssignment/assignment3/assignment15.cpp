/*
    Design a BALANCE class with account number, balance and date of last update.
    Consider a TRANSACTION class with account number, date of transaction, amount
    and transaction type (W for withdrawal and D for deposit). If it is a withdrawal
    check whether the amount is available or not. Transaction object will make necessary
    update in the BALANCE class.
